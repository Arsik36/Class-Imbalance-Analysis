# Class Imbalance Analysis
Author: Arseniy Barmin

### Company introduction
This is an un-named company whose business model centers on scheduling customers to come in for a medical appointment.

### Case context
This business noticed that 20% of its customers who book an appointment end up missing out on their scheduled visit. This involves financial losses for that business, as someone else could have been scheduled for this time who would come in and receive a paid-for service.

Thus, this company has hired me to:
- Analyze their data
- Develop my top insights
- Build a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to not show up for their scheduled appointment

### Business question

Build a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to not show up for their scheduled appointment.
